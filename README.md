# Bioactivity-Project
This is a quantitative structure-activity relationship model QSAR for drug discovery which uses machine learning and data science for computational drug discovery. 
1- A machine learning model using the ChEMBL bioactivity data.
2- performing Descriptor Calculation and Exploratory Data Analysis.
3- calculating molecular descriptors that are essentially quantitative description of the compounds in the dataset. Finally, prepare this into a dataset for subsequent model building.
4- building a regression model of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors using the random forest algorithm.
5- comparing several ML algorithms for building regression models of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
